Python Analyst Exercise
===============

This is app to calculate the shopping basket total. We currently have the following items:
- Apples
- Bread
- Milk
- Soup

We can update the available products inside PriceBasket.py. We can also update the current offers here too. 

## Running Instructions
We can run the price basket app by entering the following Input in the command line:

```
python3 main/PriceBasket.py item1 item2 item3
```

e.g. 
```
python3 main/PriceBasket.py Apples Bread Soup
```

Note: We can add any many items as we want, separated by a space. The only requirement is that we need to have at least one item.
